<h1> Engeto PowerBI project </h1>

Similarly as for SQL project, this project comes from Engeto data (+ python) academy. In this case we had the option to choose which data to visualize and I couldnt resist to deep dive into Czech transport ministry dataset.
The most work has been done in the cleaning part since the data is really ugly which kinda got me thinking in what chaos the czech DMVs function. But it was fun at the same time (e.g. there is a car in Czechia which instead of Mitsubishi
is called, accroding to the offical documents) Mitsububishi). On the other hand, the data care would still need some extended effort (e.g. using some kind of ML library) since there are still some potential errors either in the car maker name
or the model/specification etc (but thats outside the scope of the project). Also it seems the DMVs switched to a bit different system of mapping somewhere during 2000s and around 2015 hence from first look it might seem like so few motobikes
were registered since then but new system of categories was used instead. Unfortunately, the source doesnt provied new mapping table/s nor responds to emails regarding this topic. That begs the question, what else was changed to be
yet uncovered?
